# Sitespeed.io

Sitespeed.io is an open source tool (Apache License Version 2.0) that helps you analyze your website speed and performance based on performance best practices and timing metrics. It collects data from multiple pages on your website, analyze them using the rules and output the result as HTML or send the metrics to Graphite.

You can analyze one site, analyze and compare multiple sites or let your continuous integration server break your build when your performance budget is exceeded.
